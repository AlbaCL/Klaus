# Klaus

This is the code repository from the paper *Design of quantum optical experiments with logic artificial intelligence* by Alba Cervera-Lierta, Mario Krenn and AlÃ¡n Aspuru-Guzik, (arXiv:2109.13273 (2021)
)[https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.13273].

You can find the Mathematica notebooks (also in pdf format) of:

- `Klaus`: Main algorithm (logic-based)
- `Klaus_vs_Theseus`: Comparison between Klaus algorithm and Theseus (see (Phys. Rev. X 11, 031044 (2021))[https://journals.aps.org/prx/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevX.11.031044])
- `Monocolored_graphs`: logic clauses to solve the monocromatic edge problem (generation of GHZ states of *n* parties and *d>=n/2* colors)
